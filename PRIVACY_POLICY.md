## Basic Math Training: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Basic Math Training app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Ruslan Mikhno and designed to help you practice simple math (arithmetic operations).

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences\settings\etc) created by you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Ruslan Mikhno
